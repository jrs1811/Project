There's more left for you
So have some rest your worries
Honey just have fun now
You won't regret, not a single sec'
There's something 'bout the way you look, honey
And if I had the chance to make you mine
It would be so nice, so nice
Be so nice
La, la, la, la, la
Come back
La (ha)
La (so much)
Come back, come back
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
It could be true
It could be you
Love is with us
Who ever knew
Just wanna make you see what I see under the moon
Kissing you would be
It could be true
It could be you
Love is with us
Who ever knew
Just wanna make you see what I see under the moon
Kissing you would be
Kissing you would that be so nice
